DONE ->
- add a button as reset duration on the header
- the MIN_DELTA of 20 as a delta doesent work for shorter videos so have it flexible instead of 20 constant as it doesent work w the 8sec reel
- font sizes relative to the videos lenght and UI
- dragging from right and canvas trim at te same time hence giving a weird UX, fixed
- click gray and white
- video should not be alloweed to drag beyond itself
- ruler/scale is indeed updating
- +10 and -10s
